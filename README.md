# ⚙️ AlgoShelf – Console-Based Algorithm Library in C++

**AlgoShelf** is a menu-driven console application that serves as a personal archive of commonly used algorithms written in **C++**. It includes structured implementations of searching, sorting, greedy strategies, dynamic programming problems, and graph algorithms — all accessible via an interactive terminal interface.
